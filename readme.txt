project built upon "gametemplate2008" by my tafe lecturer which handles all sound crap i was forced to ad as part of assignment requirements
code in the "common" folder is his, rest is mine...


for some reason he set up the project to use fixed paths so if you have directx sdk in "program files (x86)" then use the .vcproj already in the folder, if it's in "program files" then rename the strangely named .vcproj file...
